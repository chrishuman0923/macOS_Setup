# macOS Setup

## Overview

Getting a new device; it is a day that developers look forward to and dread in equal measure. Why you ask?

Don't misunderstand, we love getting a new device. It gives us a clean slate to start fresh and, usually, a new device means a hardware upgrade to some degree.

But, this new device brings with it a problem. For most of us, we will spend the better part of a day setting it up. From downloading countless applications, to updating countless config files; it is a chore to set up a new device to make it conducive for development.

I was convinced there had to be a better way. Luckily, I am not the first developer who wished they could simplify their on-boarding process.

### TLDR

This repository walks you through the steps (_including terminal commands and config files_) I take when on-boarding a new macOS device for web application development.

## Pre-Requisites

1.  Sign in to iCloud account
1.  Download Xcode command line tools

    - Needed by many npm packages

      ```
      xcode-select --install
      ```

1.  Download Oh-My-Zsh

    - Terminal framework for adding plugins and themes to improve standard Zsh shell

      ```
      sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
      ```

1.  Zsh Profile, Aliases, and Plugins

    - Configuration profile for Zsh shell

      ```
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishuman0923/macOS_Setup/master/config/zsh/.zshrc > ~/.zshrc
      ```

    - Configure Zsh shell command aliases

      ```
      curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishuman0923/macOS_Setup/master/config/zsh/alias.zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/alias.zsh
      ```

    - Clone source code for auto-suggestion plugin

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions \${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestion
      ```

## Git Configuration

- Set user details

  ```
  git config --global user.name ‚ÄúChris Human‚Äù
  git config --global user.email ‚Äúemail@email.com‚Äù
  ```

- Set global ignore file

  ```
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishuman0923/macOS_Setup/master/config/git/.gitignore_global > ~/.gitignore_global
  git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
  ```

- Set `git pull` default behavior

  ```
  git config --global pull.rebase false
  ```

- Set VS Code as Git core editor

  ```
  git config --global core.editor ‚Äúcode -w‚Äù
  ```

- Set VS Code as Git diff editor

  ```
  git config --global diff.tool vscode
  git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code -w --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"
  ```

- Set VS Code as Git merge editor

  ```
  git config --global merge.tool vscode
  git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd "code -w $MERGED"
  ```

## SSH Key Configuration

I configure Github with an ssh key to avoid entering my Github credentials each time I interact with a remote and to avoid adding my Github credentials to iCloud Keychain.

- Generate ssh key for Github

  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C email@email.com -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
  ```

- Confirm ssh-agent is running

  ```
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ```

- Add private key to ssh-agent

  ```
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
  ```

- Copy public key to clipboard and add it to Github [here](https://github.com/settings/keys)

  ```
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub | pbcopy
  ```

- Confirm ssh authentication is set up correctly

  ```
  ssh -T git@github.com
  ```

## Notes

Unfortunatley, this process does not include signing in to all of the accounts for the applications installed. Maybe in a future update. ü§ûüèª üòÅ
